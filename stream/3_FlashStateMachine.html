<h1>State machines in Flash</h1>

<p>
Flash's movieclips were sort of state machines. 
In their most basic form, they transition from one state (keyframe) to the next on each new frame.
However, a movieclip's keyframes could also be controlled more explicitly. 
Each keyframe could be assigned a label, and a Flash developer could programmatically
cause the transition from one keyframe to another, via the gotoAndPlay or gotoAndStop functions.

I remember often using movieclips as state machines. I wonder if that contributed to the seeming ease
of making games in Flash.
