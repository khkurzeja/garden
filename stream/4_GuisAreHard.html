<h1>GUIs are hard</h1>

<p>
I feel like I have spent far too much time in the past trying to make nice GUIs
and ultimately finishing nothing interesting at all.
I should probably make a concious effort to not make GUIs.
Maybe I should lean into everything being hotkeys and other simple interactions.
