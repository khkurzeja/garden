<h1>First</h1>

<p>
This is the first post of my garden stream.
The garden stream represents a stream of conciousness. 
It is a barely organized collection of my thoughts over time.
By maintaining the stream, my thoughts and ideas should not be completely lost to time, as has happened many times.
Updating the stream (and the garden generally) should be as simple and frictionless as possible.
If updating the stream feels like a hassle, then the process must be simplified.
I hope to keep this chaotic to encourage creativity.

My digital garden is heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.todepond.com/">todepond dot com</a>.

It is my piece of the <a href="https://www.tadiweb.com/">tadiweb</a>. 
<br />
Keep it slippy.
