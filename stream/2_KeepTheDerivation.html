<h1>Don't lose the derivation</h1>

<p>
It is often vitally important that a program's source code is understandable to people who did not write the original code.
Thus, the source code should communicate the author's understanding of how it works. 
Sometimes, but often not, the author will write comments describing how the code works. 
These comments are often incomplete and may become incorrect as the code is modified.
</p>

<p>
I believe that source code should include its derivation. 
Ideally, the derivation is not just appended to the code as a comment or as an external link,
but, in some significant way, the derivation should <b>be</b> the code.
</p>

<p>
As an example, I typically work on geometry based code.
I frequently read and write code that was derived on paper and then translated into traditional source code.
The derivation is never preserved in the translation.
The derivation often involves drawing one or more geometric diagrams that represent the transformation of input values into the desired output values.
Arithmetic formulas are produced from the geometric procedures, and these formulas are often simplified algebraically before they are written as code.
Thus, the source code not only loses the visual, geometric information from the derivation, but the derived formulas are algebraically optimized into an even more obfuscated form.
Geometric diagrams and algebra are difficult enough to understand on their own.
How can we expect future programmers to understand code written like this?
</p>

<p>
The steps taken to draw the geometric diagrams contain all of the information needed to compute the desired output. 
In other words, the geometric diagrams (or rather, the steps taken to create them) should be recognized as valid source code of the program.
Similarly, the algebraic simplifications should also be considered a valid part of the source code.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, current programming environments do not empower programmers to use these derivations as source code.
So, programmers are forced to translate these derivations into standard programming langages, while losing important information in the process.
Much like the compilation of standard text-based code into machine code.
</p>

<p>
How can future programming environments enable programmers to preserve their entire derivations as source code? 
</p>

<p>
Not everyone works in geometry, so an environment that works well for me may not work well for others.
It seems likely that domain specific languages and environments will need to be designed to enable working in various fields.
