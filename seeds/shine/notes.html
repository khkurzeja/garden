# Primitives
- Integers
- Floats
- Bool
    - I can let this be a primitive for now. Eventually, it could be a sprite with a true and false state.
- Sprites
- Graphics
    - Is this a sprite?

# Sprite
- May take 0+ inputs
    - A sprite is kind of like a function. It and its contents are the "output".
- Has id (string name, probably)
- States
    - Either: keyframe num or labeled
    - The states could have inputs. Transitioning to a new state might require some input(s).
    - As in, what does it take to construct a state?
    - Each state has a construction. The sequence of steps needed to create it.
    - States may be used like enum/variant options
- Previously, I wanted everything to be a sprite. Maybe this can still happen eventually, but it is difficult to start with.

# Graphics
- Frame (similarity transform.)
    - "Frame" is too easily consfusable with keyframe
    - Should this be part of the sprite
    - Sprites may not necessarily need a spatial component. Not sure yet.
- Layers
    - Should graphics have layers, or should graphics be inside layers?
- Sketch strokes (lines, arcs, [prob nothing else for now])
- Fill strokes
- Triangle(s)
- Text
- Bitmap
